## Firebase Config File is required to run this project.

- Create New [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Create a New App from Firebase
- You will get the config from firebase
  - Place your config in a .env file. .env should be in the root level of your directory.
  - Follow the React env naming convention
  - In the src -> actions -> jobActions file rename the variables according to your .env.

### PLEASE NOTE:

- This project requires seeder data to run.
- The seeder data is in the src -> seeder.js file.
- THe postedDateTime field needs to be converted to a timestamp on the time of seeding otherwise the sorting will not work. You can use the following code to convert the date to a timestamp.
  - `import {  serverTimestamp } from "firebase/firestore";`
  - `jobs.map((job) => { job.postedDateTime = serverTimestamp();`
- Seed the data to your firebase database.

### To run this project locally

- Run the following command
  - #### `npm i`
  - #### `npm start` to start the development server.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
